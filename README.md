Grooveshark Autoplayer
======================

A simple Windows Grooveshark client that automatically plays when other applications are quiet and automatically pauses when they're not. 

Built using the [Grooveshark Javascript API](http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/) and the [CSCore audio library](http://cscore.codeplex.com/)

##Basic use case 
I'm listening to music but would like to do something else with audio in it (eg: watch a video). Normally, I'd pause the music, watch the video and then have to start the music again when the video stops. Instead, this client pauses the music as soon as the video start playing and then starts it again when the video stops again.
